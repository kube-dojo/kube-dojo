"""Per-stage orchestration: audit / route / write / verify / review / merge.

The state machine lives in :mod:`state` (durable states + leases + CAS).
This module drives state forward by calling dispatchers, running the
citation verify pass inside a per-module worktree, and calling the
worktree helpers to merge cleanly.

Directly closes the remaining Codex must-fixes:

* **#1** — :func:`review_one` reads the module from the writer's
  worktree, not from ``main``. The v1 bug was catastrophic: reviewer
  always approved because the worktree changes were invisible to it.
* **#4** — :func:`handle_review_changes` routes ``REVIEW_CHANGES`` back
  to ``WRITE_PENDING`` with the reviewer's ``must_fix`` list as
  retry context, bumping ``retry_count``. After ``RETRY_CAP`` retries,
  :func:`tiebreaker_one` calls Gemini to break the loop.

And the crash-resume correctness:

* **#5 (runtime half)** — :func:`recover_in_progress` reconciles
  ``WRITE_IN_PROGRESS`` / ``REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS`` state on startup. If
  the writer's branch has a commit, advance to ``WRITE_DONE`` (don't
  redo the work); else revert to ``WRITE_PENDING``. Pairs with the
  ``attempt_id`` stamping from :mod:`state.start_in_progress`.

      inside it; changes get amended into the writer's commit. Exit:
      ``REVIEW_PENDING``.
    * **Cleanup-only path** — entered at ``CITATION_CLEANUP_ONLY``
      (score ≥ 4.0 + structure complete). No worktree exists yet; we
      create one fresh from ``main`` so the primary checkout never
      mutates (Codex fatal #1). If nothing changes, we tear down the
      worktree and exit ``SKIPPED``. If something changes, we commit
      in the worktree and exit ``REVIEW_APPROVED`` — reviewer is
      skipped because the writer is the citation verifier itself.
    * **Resume** — if a SIGKILL landed after the stage entered
      ``CITATION_VERIFY``, the saved ``citation_origin`` field tells us
      which of the above paths to continue. The work is idempotent
      (re-fetching URLs + re-verifying produces the same verdicts) so
      re-running is safe. Closes Codex must #3.
