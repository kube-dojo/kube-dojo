"""Dispatch cross-family verdict pass on AI History chapter-research PRs (#394).

For each PR:
1. Read brief.md, sources.md, open-questions.md, scene-sketches.md from
   the PR branch (`git show <branch>:<path>`).
2. Fire Codex anchor-verification (gpt-5.5, reasoning=high) — can use
   the shell to curl/pdftotext/grep specific page anchors.
3. Fire Gemini structural gap-audit (lane-disciplined per
   feedback_gemini_hallucinates_anchors.md — NO URL citations from
   Gemini; structural gaps only).
4. Post both reviews as PR comments.

Codex and Gemini run on different families, so a Codex queue and a
Gemini queue can run in parallel. Within a family, dispatches are
sequential per feedback_codex_dispatch_sequential.md and
reference_gemini_collab.md.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python scripts/dispatch_research_verdict.py 456 459 460 ...
    .venv/bin/python scripts/dispatch_research_verdict.py --only codex 456
    .venv/bin/python scripts/dispatch_research_verdict.py --only gemini 456

Posts comments via `gh pr comment <pr> --body-file ...`.

        # Verdict Pass — Codex Anchor Verification (`{slug}`)

        You are the cross-family Codex reviewer for an AI History
        chapter research contract. Your lane is **anchor verification**:
        confirm that primary-source URLs, page numbers, DOIs, and quoted
        passages actually exist and say what the contract claims.

        ## Background

        Chapter contracts are the gating artifact between research and
        prose. Per `docs/research/ai-history/TEAM_WORKFLOW.md`, drafting
        does not unlock until the contract gets `READY_TO_DRAFT` or
        `READY_TO_DRAFT_WITH_CAP` from a cross-family reviewer.

        Gemini was removed from research duties in April 2026 after URL
        and page-anchor hallucinations (Issue #421, commit 03640e20).
        That makes anchor verification YOUR specialty — you have shell
        access (curl, pdftotext, pdfgrep, ocrmypdf) and can hit primary
        sources directly.

        ## Your job

        Review the contract below. For up to **8 of the most
        load-bearing Green claims** in `sources.md`, attempt to verify:
        - the URL or DOI resolves
        - the cited page or section actually contains the quoted text
          or the claim it's said to support
        - the bibliographic identifier matches the work cited

        For each claim you check, classify the result:
        - `ANCHOR_VERIFIED` — fetched and confirmed
        - `ANCHOR_PARTIAL` — source resolves but page/quote does not match
        - `ANCHOR_BROKEN` — URL is dead, paywalled, or the quote is wrong
        - `UNREACHABLE` — paywall / auth / region blocked you

        Don't try to verify all claims; pick the highest-leverage ones.
        Skip claims already marked Yellow or Red.

        ...

        ### Cross-cutting issues
        - <e.g. JSTOR paywalls block 4/8 anchors; suggest open mirrors>
        - <e.g. one DOI mismatched the cited author>

        # Verdict Pass — Gemini Structural Gap Audit (`{slug}`)

        You are the cross-family Gemini reviewer for an AI History
        chapter research contract. Your lane is **structural gap
        analysis** — what scenes are thin, what arguments lack
        scaffolding, where the contract over- or under-claims relative
        to its sources.

        ## CRITICAL LANE DISCIPLINE — read this first

        **Do not cite URLs, page numbers, or DOIs in your review.**
        After repeated URL and page-anchor hallucinations (Issue #421,
        commit 03640e20), Gemini was removed from anchor-verification
        duty. Codex handles that lane. Your job is structural and
        narrative — you may quote the contract back to itself, but you
        may NOT introduce new sources, URLs, or page anchors. If you
        catch yourself about to write a URL or "page N", STOP and
        rephrase the gap structurally.

        ## Your job

        Review the contract below. Focus on:

        1. **Scene structure** — Are the 5 scenes coherent and
           differentiated, or do two of them collapse into one?
        2. **Prose Capacity Plan layers** — Does each layer have a
           plausible narrative shape, or are some layers thin
           padding?
        3. **Boundary contract** — Does the chapter say clearly what
           it is NOT? Are forward-references properly sparse?
        4. **People coverage** — Are the named protagonists actually
           necessary for the chapter's argument, or are some included
           for completeness without scenes?
        5. **Open questions** — Are the named gaps the *right* gaps?
           Are there obvious holes the contract doesn't acknowledge?
        6. **Word-count discipline label** — Does the label match what
           the Prose Capacity Plan can actually carry?

        Avoid commenting on anchor accuracy — that's Codex's job. If
        you suspect an anchor is wrong, flag it as
        "Codex-please-verify" without naming a specific URL or page.

        ## Output (Markdown, ≤700 words)

        ```
        ## Gemini Structural Gap Audit — `{slug}`

        ### Scenes
        - <gap or strength, no URLs>

        ### Prose Capacity Plan
        - <layer-by-layer assessment>

        ### Boundary contract
        - <strength or weakness>
