"""Supply-chain DETECTION tripwire — issue #1812 (Miasma-class worm defense).

`.npmrc` sets `ignore-scripts=true` (PREVENTION: dependency lifecycle scripts do
not execute on install). This is DETECTION: it scans the dependency tree and FAILS
if a dependency can run install-time code that has not been explicitly audited —
so a freshly-introduced hook (the Miasma worm republishes packages with forged
provenance) is surfaced for human review instead of sitting silent until someone
runs `npm install` on a machine without the guard.

Authoritative source = `package-lock.json`, NOT the installed `node_modules`:
  - The lockfile lists EVERY dependency, including OS-gated optional ones that are
    not installed on this machine (e.g. `fsevents` on Linux) — node_modules misses
    those (cross-family review, codex/deepseek).
  - npm's `hasInstallScript` flag is TRUE for preinstall/install/postinstall AND
    for implicit node-gyp builds (`binding.gyp` with no declared script) — reading
    `package.json.scripts` alone misses the latter (e.g. `fsevents`).
  - The lockfile PATH (`node_modules/<name>`) is the resolved identity, so a
    package that lies about its `name` in package.json cannot spoof the allow-list,
    and a package with a null/empty name cannot evade the scan (review: all three).

Three gates (any violation => exit 1):
  1. INSTALL HOOKS: every `hasInstallScript` package must be in ALLOWLIST_INSTALL.
  2. ALLOW-LIST ABUSE: an allow-listed package's *declared* install hooks must be a
     subset of EXPECTED_HOOKS — so a compromised esbuild/sharp that adds a rogue
     preinstall is still caught.
  3. NON-REGISTRY SOURCE: any dep resolved from git/local/tarball is flagged — those
     bypass registry signing and DO run `prepare` on install (the `prepare` surface
     that npm's `hasInstallScript` does not cover; registry deps do not run `prepare`
     on `npm ci`).

Adding to any allow-list is a security decision — review it in its own commit.

Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = unaudited install-time code found (or lockfile missing).
