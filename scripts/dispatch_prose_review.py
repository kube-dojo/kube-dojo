"""Dispatch a cross-family prose review on an AI History chapter PR (#394).

Mirrors `dispatch_research_verdict.py` but reads the prose file from the
prose branch instead of the research contract from the research branch,
and asks the reviewer for a source-fidelity (Claude) or prose-quality
(Codex / Gemini) check rather than an anchor-verification verdict.

The reviewer always reads the approved research contract on the chapter's
research branch, so that source-fidelity claims can be cross-checked
against the contract that gated the prose draft.

Per the 2026-04-29 prose pipeline pivot
(`docs/research/ai-history/TEAM_WORKFLOW.md` § 5b–7):

- Claude opus does **source-fidelity** review on Codex-expanded prose.
- Codex (gpt-5.5) does **prose-quality** review on Claude-expanded prose
  (the Claude-default cohort, Ch01-05).
- Gemini does **prose-quality** review when Codex bandwidth is exhausted.

Usage:

    .venv/bin/python scripts/dispatch_prose_review.py 480 \\
        --reviewer claude

    .venv/bin/python scripts/dispatch_prose_review.py 483 \\
        --reviewer codex

Posts the review as a PR comment via `gh pr comment`.

        # Claude Source-Fidelity Review — `{slug}` (PR #{pr_num})

        You are the cross-family Claude reviewer for Codex-expanded
        prose. Your lane is **source fidelity**: confirm that every
        load-bearing factual claim, quote, and named anchor in the
        prose can be located in the approved research contract below.

        ## The strict-source rule (load-bearing)

        Per the 2026-04-29 prose pipeline pivot (TEAM_WORKFLOW.md § 5b),
        the expander was instructed to use ONLY the provided contract
        and claim matrix — no source additions, no new page anchors,
        no Yellow→Green upgrades, no invented examples or
        institutional motives.

        Your job is to verify the expander honoured that rule, and to
        flag any prose claim that:
        - cites a source not present in `sources.md`
        - states a fact (date, name, place, quote, page anchor) absent
          from the contract
        - upgrades a Yellow/Red claim to Green confidence
        - introduces an interpretive or motive claim outside the
          boundary contract in `brief.md`
        - quotes material without an anchor in the contract
        - elides material from a quoted passage without marking the cut

        Also check basic source-fidelity hygiene:
        - quoted text matches the contract verbatim (or marks elisions)
        - named persons, dates, places, journals match the contract
        - "according to X" attributions match the contract's citation
        - hedges (Yellow) are preserved as hedges, not flattened

        ## Output (Markdown, ≤700 words)

        ```
        ## Claude Source-Fidelity Review — {slug}

        ### Sampled fidelity checks
        | Prose claim (line) | Contract anchor | Status | Notes |
        |---|---|:-:|---|
        | ... | sources.md row 3 / brief.md scene 2 | OK | matches |

        # Codex Prose Review — `{slug}` (PR #{pr_num})

        You are the cross-family Codex reviewer on a Claude-expanded
        prose chapter (or, for Part 2 forward, the prose-quality
        reviewer on a Codex-expanded chapter). Your lane is
        **prose-quality + factual-anchor verification** — combining
        Codex's anchor-discipline strength with structural prose
        review.

        You have shell access (curl, pdftotext, pdfgrep) and may
        verify primary sources directly. Pick up to 5 of the most
        load-bearing factual anchors and confirm them.

        ## The strict-source rule

        Per TEAM_WORKFLOW.md § 5b–7, the expander was instructed to
        use ONLY the approved contract — no source additions, no new
        page anchors, no Yellow→Green upgrades. Flag any prose claim
        that cannot be located in the contract.

        ## Your job

        Sample 5 high-leverage anchors. For each:
        - Confirm the URL/DOI resolves and the cited page contains
          the claimed text (✅ / PARTIAL / ❌).
        - Note the exact prose line and contract row.

        Then scan the prose for:
        - factual errors (dates, names, places, ages, journal titles)
        - anachronisms or backward-projection of later concepts
        - over-staged scene description ("the same room that…",
          motive claims without source)
        - over-tight hedges (Yellow flattened to Green)
        - over-loose hedges (Green over-hedged into vagueness)
        - boundary creep (claims belonging to a different chapter)

        ## Output (Markdown, ≤700 words)

        # Gemini Prose Review — `{slug}` (PR #{pr_num})

        You are the cross-family Gemini reviewer on a Codex- or
        Claude-expanded prose chapter. Your lane is **contract-
        traceability sampling + readability + boundary discipline** —
        does the prose stay inside the approved contract, does it read
        well, does it stay inside the chapter's scope.

        **Lane closure (Issue #421):** Do NOT verify primary-source
        URLs or page anchors yourself. Gemini's anchor-fetching lane
        was closed on 2026-04-27 after a hallucinated-anchors audit.
        If a prose claim's correctness requires URL/page-number
        confirmation, flag it as `NEEDS_CODEX_OR_CLAUDE_VERIFY` and
        leave the verification to the Codex or Claude reviewer pass.

        ## The strict-source rule

        Per TEAM_WORKFLOW.md § 5b–7, the expander was instructed to
        use ONLY the approved contract — no source additions, no new
        page anchors, no Yellow→Green upgrades. Flag any prose claim
        that cannot be located in the staged contract files.

        ## Your job

        Sample 5 high-leverage prose claims. For each, locate the
        matching contract row (brief / sources / scene-sketches /
        timeline / people / infrastructure-log) and mark:
        - **TRACED** — claim is supported by an identifiable contract row
        - **GAP** — claim is not in the contract (likely fabrication)
        - **NEEDS_CODEX_OR_CLAUDE_VERIFY** — claim needs URL or
          page-anchor check that is out of your lane

        Then scan the prose for:
        - internal inconsistencies (dates / names / numbers that
          disagree across the chapter)
        - anachronisms or backward-projection of later concepts
        - over-staged scene description (motive claims without
          source row)
        - over-tight hedges (Yellow flattened to Green)
        - over-loose hedges (Green over-hedged into vagueness)
        - boundary creep (claims belonging to a different chapter)
        - structural / readability issues (paragraph length,
          transitions, signpost density, opening hook quality)
