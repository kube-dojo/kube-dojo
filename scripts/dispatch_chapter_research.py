"""Dispatch a fresh headless Claude on per-chapter AI History research.

Replaces the inline copy-paste pattern for the Parts 1/2/6/7 re-research
queue (Issue #394, Option C from the 2026-04-28 handoff). Each call
spins up a fresh `claude/394-ch{N}-research` worktree off main, drops a
focused prompt that points the headless agent at the chapter slug
directory, and fires `agent_runtime.runner.invoke` with model
claude-opus-4-7 in workspace-write mode.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python scripts/dispatch_chapter_research.py 1 \
        --slug ch-01-the-laws-of-thought \
        --supersede-pr 425 \
        --extra-staging boole.tex,boole.txt,fix_ch1_anchor.py

The script prints the worktree path, branch, dispatch log path, and
runs the dispatch in the foreground (blocking). Caller decides whether
to background the whole script.

Chapters: 28 total across Parts 1, 2, 6, 7 per
docs/research/ai-history/README.md ownership table (Claude is research
lead; Gemini's prior PRs are to be superseded, not merged).

        outlined, but verify every page anchor independently. Many of
        Gemini's anchors are fabricated. The orchestrator will close

        # Task: Build the Chapter {ch_num} research contract for the AI History book (#394)

        You have **workspace-write** access to worktree
        `{REPO}/.worktrees/claude-394-ch{ch_num:02d}-research` on
        branch `claude/394-ch{ch_num:02d}-research` (forked off
        `main`). Edit and commit there. Do NOT touch the main
        checkout.

        ## Chapter {ch_num} — `{slug}`

        Per the new research role split (effective 2026-04-28),
        Claude owns Part {part_num} research. Build the 8-file
        chapter contract from verified primary and secondary sources.

        ## Required reading — in this exact order

        1. `docs/research/ai-history/TEAM_WORKFLOW.md` — the chapter
           lifecycle and contract structure. Pay attention to the
           **Prose Capacity Plan gate**: every layer must reference
           at least one anchored entry in `sources.md`.
        2. `docs/research/ai-history/chapters/ch-11-the-summer-ai-named-itself/brief.md`
           and `sources.md` — the gold-standard template for a
           Claude-owned anchored brief and the Green/Yellow/Red claim
           table format.
        3. `docs/research/ai-history/chapters/{slug}/` — current state
           (probably mostly empty stubs from the legacy Gemini work).
        4. `src/content/docs/ai-history/ch-{ch_num:02d}-*.md` (if it
           exists) — the legacy Gemini-drafted prose. **Do NOT trust
           its sources.** Read it only to understand what scenes are
           in scope; verify every claim independently.
        {staging_section}{supersede_section}

        ## Your output — eight files in `docs/research/ai-history/chapters/{slug}/`

        1. `brief.md` — Thesis, Scope, Boundary Contract, Scenes
           Outline (5 scenes typical), **anchored Prose Capacity
           Plan** (each layer cites specific page anchors from
           sources.md), Citation Bar, Conflict Notes, Honest
           Prose-Capacity Estimate.
        2. `sources.md` — Green/Yellow/Red claim table. Every Green
           claim has a verified anchor (page, section, or DOI+page).
           Yellow = source anchored but specific claim isn't
           page-located. Red = no verifiable anchor yet.
        3. `timeline.md` — chronology with key dated events.
        4. `people.md` — actors with verified facts.
        5. `infrastructure-log.md` — computing infrastructure each
           scene relied on.
        6. `scene-sketches.md` — 5 scenes mapped 1:1 to Prose
           Capacity Plan layers. Match Ch11's prose density.
        7. `open-questions.md` — what's still Yellow/Red, what
           archival access would help.
        8. `status.yaml` — set `status: capacity_plan_anchored` ONLY
           if every Prose Capacity Plan layer references a real
           sources.md page anchor; otherwise
           `capacity_plan_drafted`. Include green/yellow/red counts.

        ## Hard rules — non-negotiable

        - **NEVER fabricate URLs, page numbers, DOIs, or quotes.**
          This is the rule that took research duties off Gemini. If
          you can't anchor a claim, mark it Yellow or Red, never
          Green.
        - **Use the shell directly.** `curl`, `pdftotext`, `pdfgrep`,
          `ocrmypdf` are all available. For paywalled PDFs (JSTOR,
          Project Euclid behind Imperva), don't fight the paywall —
          fall back to open mirrors (arXiv historical mirrors,
          Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, university repos like
          Stanford ISL, MIT DSpace, etc.) or accept Yellow on
          specific page anchors and Green on citation+intro.
        - **Boundary contract:** make it explicit. Say what the
          chapter is NOT. Forward-references are sparse pointers
          ("see Ch{ch_num + 1}"); don't anticipate later chapters'
          arguments.
        - **Honesty close in `brief.md`:** end the Prose Capacity
          Plan with "If the verified evidence runs out, cap the
          chapter."

        ## Workflow

        1. `cd /Users/krisztiankoos/projects/kubedojo/.worktrees/claude-394-ch{ch_num:02d}-research`
        2. Read TEAM_WORKFLOW, the Ch11 templates, the existing
           legacy chapter dir and prose if any, the staged files if
           any.
        3. Identify primary sources for the chapter's scope. Fetch
           and extract anchors. For each Green claim, the row must
           cite a specific page or section.
        4. Build the 8 files.
        5. Self-check: count Green/Yellow/Red; verify every plan
           layer has at least one anchored citation; verify total
           range matches a Word Count Discipline label.
        6. Delete any scratch staging files in worktree root before
           commit.
        7. `git add docs/research/ai-history/chapters/{slug}/` and
           commit:
           ```
           docs(ai-history): build chapter {ch_num} research contract (#394)

           Anchored research contract for `{slug}` per the new role
           split (Claude owns Part {part_num} research, effective
           2026-04-28). All Green claims trace to verified primary
           or secondary anchors.

           Status: capacity_plan_anchored | capacity_plan_drafted.
           N Green / N Yellow / N Red claims.
           ```
        8. Do NOT push. The orchestrator will open the PR and run
           the cross-family verdict pass.

        ## When done — print summary

        Print at the end (≤300 words):
        - Thesis (one paragraph).
        - Total Green/Yellow/Red.
        - Per-layer Prose Capacity Plan word ranges and total.
        - Word Count Discipline label.
        - Claims you wanted Green but couldn't anchor (with reason).
        - Commit SHA.
