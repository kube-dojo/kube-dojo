"""On-Prem Phase 2 — bulk module drafting WITH per-module fact-checking, NO review loop.

Bypasses the v1 pipeline's review/check/score retry loop. Per module:

  1. WRITE — call the chosen writer model (default: scripts/dispatch.py writer pin)
  2. SAVE — write the module markdown to disk
  3. FACT-CHECK — call the calibrated fact-grounder (gpt-5.3-codex-spark) on
     the just-written module, produce a structured ledger (SUPPORTED /
     CONFLICTING / UNVERIFIED / HALLUCINATED counts) saved alongside the
     module as a sibling .factcheck.json file

The user reviews drafts AND fact-check ledgers when they wake up. The ledger
makes 21 untrusted drafts into 21 drafts WITH explicit hallucination data —
the human reviewer can prioritize modules with high hallucination counts
and trust the rest.

This is the "fast progress" mode for content writing while the architecture
PR (`feat/fact-ledger-architecture`) is being built. Once the architecture
PR ships, this becomes a standard pipeline step instead of a one-off script.

Sequential by design — never parallelizes Gemini calls (per
feedback_sequential_gemini.md memory rule).

Resumable: skips modules whose target file already has >2000 chars AND a
fresh fact-check ledger. Re-runs the fact-check if the markdown is fresh
but the ledger is missing.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python scripts/on-prem/phase2-write-only.py            # all 21
    .venv/bin/python scripts/on-prem/phase2-write-only.py 1 2 3      # only the first 3 (1-indexed)
    .venv/bin/python scripts/on-prem/phase2-write-only.py --dry-run  # show what would run
    .venv/bin/python scripts/on-prem/phase2-write-only.py --writer gpt-5.4   # override writer
    .venv/bin/python scripts/on-prem/phase2-write-only.py --skip-factcheck   # write only

Environment override (set this if the rigorous writer calibration picked a
non-default model):

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are writing a complete KubeDojo curriculum module. KubeDojo is a free,
open-source cloud-native curriculum for practitioners — engineers who already know
the basics of Kubernetes and need production-grade depth.

Audience: a senior DevOps / platform engineer who needs to operate this technology
on bare metal (no cloud managed services). They are not learning Kubernetes from
scratch — they are learning the practitioner-grade operational reality of THIS
specific topic.

## Module to write

**Title**: {title}
**Slug**: on-premises/{sec}/module-{num}-{stem}
**Section**: {sec}
**Number**: {num}

**Topic and scope**:
{topic}

## Required output structure

Return ONLY the module markdown. No preamble, no commentary, no "here is the module".
Start with the YAML frontmatter delimiter `---`.

Required sections in this order:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML between `---` delimiters):
   - `title`: "{title}"
   - `description`: a one-sentence summary of what the module covers
   - `sidebar`: with `order: <derived from {num}>` (e.g. for 3.5 use 35, for 9.1 use 91)

2. **Title heading** (`# {title}`)

3. **Learning Outcomes** (`## Learning Outcomes`): a bulleted list of 4-6 specific
   skills the reader will gain. Each bullet starts with a verb (Configure, Diagnose,
   Compare, Implement, etc.). Outcomes must be measurable, not "understand X".

4. **Theory** (multiple `## Section` headings as needed): the conceptual depth needed
   to operate this technology. Include:
   - Architecture diagrams in Mermaid format where they help
   - Comparison tables when there are multiple options (Helm chart values, tool
     trade-offs, version differences)
   - Specific version numbers, API versions, deprecated paths, and current best practices
   - At least one production gotcha or war-story per major sub-section

5. **Hands-on Lab** (`## Hands-on Lab`): a runnable end-to-end exercise. Must include:
   - Prerequisites (`kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`, etc.)
   - Numbered steps with copy-pasteable commands and YAML manifests
   - Verification commands at each checkpoint
   - Expected output (`kubectl get ... -> READY`)
   - A brief "what to do if this fails" troubleshooting note for the most common failures

6. **Practitioner Gotchas** (`## Practitioner Gotchas`): 3-5 production failure modes
   that catch teams off-guard, each with 1-2 sentences of context and the fix.

7. **Quiz** (`## Quiz`): 5 scenario-based multiple-choice questions. Each question must:
   - Set up a scenario in 1-2 sentences (not just "what is X?")
   - Have 4 options (A/B/C/D)
   - Have exactly ONE correct answer marked
   - Test reasoning, not recall

8. **Further Reading** (`## Further Reading`): a bulleted list of 3-6 authoritative
   external links (official docs, CNCF announcements, project README files). NO
   blog posts unless from the project's official blog.

## Voice and quality constraints

- Practitioner-grade. Assume the reader knows what a Pod, Deployment, and Service are.
- No marketing language. Banned: "delve into", "leverage", "robust", "powerful",
  "seamless", "comprehensive", "in this section we will explore".
- Direct, terse, technically precise. Get to the point.
- All commands and YAML must be syntactically valid for current Kubernetes (1.32+).
- All version numbers, API names, helm chart values, and CRD field paths must be
  current. If you are unsure, prefer "current" framing rather than naming a specific
  version that might be wrong.
- Length target: 4000-8000 words for the full module. Long enough to have real depth,
  short enough that the reader can finish in one sitting.
- Use Starlight callout syntax for important notes: `:::note`, `:::caution`, `:::tip`.

Output ONLY the module markdown. Start with `---`. No preamble.
"""


FACT_CHECK_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are doing a fact-grounding pass on a freshly-written KubeDojo curriculum
module. Your job is to identify every externally-versioned factual claim in the
module and verify it against current authoritative upstream sources.

As-of date: {as_of_date}
Module topic: {topic_label}

For each factual claim — version numbers, API names, helm chart values, command
flags, deprecation status, project status (CNCF sandbox/incubating/graduated),
metric names, doc URLs — return one of these verdicts:

- VERIFIED: the claim is supported by current authoritative sources.
- CONFLICTING: authoritative sources disagree.
- UNVERIFIED: cannot establish a reliable answer from authoritative sources.
- HALLUCINATED: you can verify the claim is factually wrong.

Rules:
- Do NOT answer from memory. Use current upstream documentation.
- Prefer official vendor/project docs over blog posts.
- Be honest about uncertainty. UNVERIFIED costs nothing. VERIFIED on something
  you cannot actually check is the worst possible answer.
- Only flag claims a reader would actually act on. Skip narrative framing.
- HALLUCINATED is the most important verdict — it means the module asserts
  something demonstrably false.

Return strict JSON only, no prose preamble.

Required JSON shape:
{{
  "module": "{module_key}",
  "as_of_date": "{as_of_date}",
  "claims": [
    {{
      "id": "C1",
      "claim": "exact claim from the module",
      "verdict": "VERIFIED | CONFLICTING | UNVERIFIED | HALLUCINATED",
      "current_truth": "what is actually true (or null if VERIFIED matches the claim)",
      "sources": [
