"""Citation backfill orchestrator — research → inject → verify → diff-lint.

Session 5 (2026-04-19): only the `research` subcommand is implemented.
Inject / verify / diff-lint ship in follow-up sessions once research is
calibrated on the 4 pilot modules.

Usage:
    # Research phase — dispatch Codex, validate URLs, write seed JSON.
    python scripts/citation_backfill.py research <module-key>
    python scripts/citation_backfill.py research --agent gemini <module-key>
    python scripts/citation_backfill.py research --dry-run <module-key>
        # emits the Codex prompt to stdout, no dispatch, no writes

    # Other subcommands land later:
    #   inject <module-key>
    #   verify <module-key>
    #   run <module-key>       — all four phases in order

# ---- prompt --------------------------------------------------------------


RESEARCH_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are the research step of the KubeDojo citation backfill pipeline.

Your job: read the module below and return a JSON seed file that identifies
every factual claim that requires an inline citation, plus a short Further
Reading list. You do NOT rewrite the module. You do NOT add citations. You
only produce the JSON seed.

## HARD RULE: factual claims about real events MUST be cited

This rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides every audience calibration
below. The following claim classes have only THREE legal dispositions:
`supported`, `needs_allowlist_expansion`, or `cannot_be_salvaged`.
**`soften_to_illustration` is FORBIDDEN for these classes — the
validator will reject the seed.** The reason: softening an unsourced
anecdote into "for instance, a team might..." preserves the false
specifics (dollar figures, durations, timestamps) under a thin
hedging veil — that's still lying with teaching flavor. The pipeline
exists to stop exactly that.

Pick `cannot_be_salvaged` and rewrite to REMOVE the false specifics
whenever the underlying anecdote is unattributed. Do NOT add
"imagine" / "for instance" framing to a war story with fake-precise
numbers — that's softening, which is forbidden here.

- `war_story` — any anecdote naming a company, person, date, or
  event with quantitative detail ($65,000, 6 hours, 120 seconds).
  - Real and citable → `supported` (allowlisted) or
    `needs_allowlist_expansion` (off-allowlist primary source).
  - Unsourced / fabricated / composite → `cannot_be_salvaged`. The
    rewrite removes the fake specifics: keep the operational lesson,
    drop the unverified numbers and named entities.
    Example: "Within 120 seconds, automated security bots found the
    exposed AWS key… the company had incurred a $65,000 cloud billing
    charge" → "Within minutes of being pushed to a public repo,
    automated scanners can find an exposed AWS key and run up
    significant cloud bills."
- `incident` — same rule. Real outages cite or go to allowlist
  expansion; unattributed incidents collapse the false specifics
  via `cannot_be_salvaged`.
- `standard` — named specifications, regulations, RFCs. Cite the spec.
- `security_claim` — claims about real vulnerabilities, real attacks,
  real defenses. Same three-option rule. An unsourced claim with
  fake-precise impact data → `cannot_be_salvaged` (rewrite to keep
  the security principle, drop the unverified numbers).
- `statistic` — specific statistics, even verifiable ones (RFC-defined
  constants, scientific facts, well-known numbers). Two paths:
  - Real and citable → `supported` with the primary source. The IPv6
    address-space size, RFC-defined ports, established scientific
    constants — these have authoritative URLs. PREFER this path.
  - Truly unciteable / illustrative-only → `cannot_be_salvaged` with
    a rewrite that removes the precise number ("IPv6 has an
    enormous 128-bit address space"). NEVER `soften_to_illustration`.

If you find yourself reaching for `soften_to_illustration` on one of
these classes, switch to `cannot_be_salvaged` (rewrite removing the
specifics) or `supported`/`needs_allowlist_expansion` (find the source).
The schema validator will block any soften on these classes.

Claims that MAY be softened (audience calibration applies):
- `vendor_capability` — IF presented as illustrative ("AWS
  instances can cost a few cents per hour"). SPECIFIC vendor
  behavior statements ("kubelet uses X by default since 1.27") must
  be cited.
- `benchmark`, `pricing` — IF illustrative teaching numbers. Dated
  specific quotes must cite or be removed.

## Universal citation discipline (NOT a prose-style mandate)

IMPORTANT: this section governs CITATION patterns only. It does NOT
tell you to rewrite the module's voice, pacing, or teaching style.
The module's voice is preserved by the inject step (which swaps only
specific sentences, never freely rewrites). Your job here is the
citation layer underneath whatever voice the author chose.

Citation discipline (applies at every audience tier):
- Target density: kubernetes.io/docs. They cite RFCs, KEPs, CVEs,
  upstream design docs — NOT every sentence. Worked examples and
  connective prose carry themselves.
- Cite specifics (dated numbers, CVEs, version-specific behavior,
  vendor capability statements). Do NOT cite teaching flow,
  analogies, or pedagogical framing.
- Prefer one authoritative reference over three adjacent weak anchors.
- Hedging prose ("may", "sometimes", "depending on") is a yellow flag:
  if load-bearing, the specific case should be citable or softened.

What this does NOT mean:
- Do NOT demand the module read like a k8s reference doc. Absolute-
  beginner modules legitimately use warm analogies, longer paragraphs,
  and slower pacing. That's correct for their audience.
- Do NOT flag analogies ("the CPU is a chef") as unciteable. Analogies
  are teaching tools, not factual claims. They produce NO seed entry.

{audience_guidance}

## What MUST be cited (inline in a later step)

- war stories, incident timelines, legal cases
- specific statistics, benchmarks, pricing
- standards, regulations, curricula references by name
- vendor capability claims ("X supports Y since version Z")
- security or safety claims tied to a real incident

## What must NOT produce a claim entry

- teaching analogies ("the CPU is like a chef")
- connective instructor prose ("this matters because...")
- questions, quiz items, exercise steps
- Mermaid diagrams, code blocks, tables (unless the table row is itself a
  factual vendor/statistic claim)

If the module is purely pedagogical with zero hard claims, return an empty
`claims` array and 2–3 Further Reading entries appropriate to the topic.
This is a legitimate, expected output for intro modules.

## CRITICAL: disposition per claim — 5 states, pick the right one

Every claim gets exactly one `disposition`. This is the most
important judgment you make. Do not force URLs that don't honestly
back the claim, but also do not dump teaching examples into an
unfixable bucket — good pedagogy uses grounded hypotheticals.

- **`supported`** — URL's page directly discusses THIS specific
  claim. K8s Windows-support → `kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/windows/`.
  Transformer paper → `arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762`. Primary source.

  **HARD TEST** before choosing `supported`: can you point at a
  specific passage in the URL that contains THIS claim's facts —
  the specific number, date, named entity, or quoted phrase? If
  you cannot honestly answer "yes, that exact passage is on that
  page," DO NOT use `supported`. A topically-adjacent URL is NOT
  support. Vendor homepages and "what is X" landing pages
  almost never back specific stat claims like "200+ services" or
  "10,000 customers" — those numbers float across marketing
  contexts and the homepage rarely repeats them verbatim.

  When in doubt, pick `cannot_be_salvaged` (rewrite to remove the
  specific) or `needs_allowlist_expansion` (the right primary
  source is off-allowlist). Removing a load-bearing number is
  better than citing a URL that doesn't actually back it — the
  semantic verifier WILL catch the mismatch and the seed will fail.

- **`weak_anchor`** — URL is a category/topic page that touches the
  subject but doesn't confirm the specific number/event. Acceptable
  ONLY for loose claims ("browsers use memory"); never for specific
  ones.

- **`needs_allowlist_expansion`** — the claim is REAL and
  VERIFIABLE, but its primary source is NOT on the allowlist.
  Set `proposed_url` to the URL you WOULD have used (the off-list
  primary source). Set `proposed_tier` to null. The claim stays in
  the module unchanged for now; a separate allowlist-review process
  decides whether to add that domain.
  Example: GitLab 2017 outage → `about.gitlab.com/.../postmortem/`.
  If that host is not in the allowlist below, this is the right
  disposition.

- **`soften_to_illustration`** — the module uses a SPECIFIC number
  or scenario as a TEACHING EXAMPLE for a real underlying principle.
  The number itself isn't citable (it's illustrative), but the
  LESSON POINT is. Supply TWO things:
  1. `suggested_rewrite`: the sentence rewritten with explicit
     framing: "for instance,", "imagine", "a typical case", or an
     approximate form ("roughly"). Keep the pedagogical force.
  2. `lesson_point_url`: an allowlisted URL citing the GENERAL
     principle the example teaches (e.g. over-provisioning is
     common, browser memory varies widely).
  `proposed_url` / `proposed_tier` null.
  Example: "a team might pay $400/month for a 32GB server when
  they only use 2GB" → rewrite as "a team might easily pay
  hundreds of dollars per month for a server they only use a
  fraction of" + lesson_point_url to a FinOps / right-sizing doc.

- **`cannot_be_salvaged`** — false precision, verbatim quotes
  without a source, or opinions dressed as measurements. Rewrite
  the sentence to remove the false claim while preserving the
  teaching intent. Supply `suggested_rewrite`; `proposed_url`,
  `proposed_tier`, `lesson_point_url` all null.
  Examples:
  - "AWS listed t2.large at $0.0928/hr on April 15 2026" →
    rewrite: "a small AWS VM typically costs a few cents per
    hour, depending on region and instance type."
  - "OrbStack is the fastest, lightest, best-UX option" →
    rewrite: "OrbStack is a popular option known for speed and
    polished UX."

Decision rules (strict):
- Dated historical price with an exact amount (e.g. "$0.0928/hr on
  April 15 2026") → `cannot_be_salvaged` ALWAYS. Vendor pricing
  pages change; a URL for the instance family does NOT back the
  historical snapshot. Rewrite to "a few cents per hour, depending
  on region and instance type" or similar.
- Illustrative dollar amount in teaching prose ("a team might pay
  $400/month for a 32GB server") → `soften_to_illustration`.
- Specific percentage at a specific date (e.g. "60.8% in March
  2026") → `supported` ONLY if the live dashboard shows roughly
  that figure; else `soften_to_illustration` ("most common",
  "roughly X%").
- Real outage / incident with primary source off-allowlist →
  `needs_allowlist_expansion`.
- Superlative without benchmark ("fastest", "best UX") →
  `cannot_be_salvaged`.
- Exact quote / verbatim claim without interview source →
  `cannot_be_salvaged`.
- Back-of-envelope calculations presented as facts (e.g. "AGC had
  74 KB") → `soften_to_illustration` with the primary source as
  lesson_point, and a rewrite that rounds or qualifies the number.

Bias toward honesty. A truthful disposition is better than a
forced weak anchor.

## CRITICAL: `anchor_text` for rewrite dispositions

For EVERY `soften_to_illustration` or `cannot_be_salvaged` claim,
you MUST supply an `anchor_text` field. The orchestrator uses it
to do a deterministic substring swap: it finds `anchor_text` in
the module body and replaces it with your `suggested_rewrite`.

Rules (strict):
1. `anchor_text` MUST be a VERBATIM substring of the module body.
   Copy-paste from the module; do NOT paraphrase, do NOT drop
   backticks, do NOT change case, do NOT fix typos. If the body
   says "a Linux `t2.large` instance", the anchor must include
   the backticks. If the body says "30 tabs", not "Thirty tabs".
2. `anchor_text` MUST be on a single line. No newline characters.
3. `anchor_text` SHOULD be the smallest substring that captures
   the full claim — usually one sentence or one clause. Do NOT
   include trailing period+space+next-sentence.
4. `anchor_text` SHOULD appear in the body EXACTLY ONCE. If the
   same phrasing appears twice, make the anchor longer to
   disambiguate.
5. `suggested_rewrite` replaces `anchor_text` verbatim. After the
   swap, surrounding punctuation (commas, periods, spaces) will
   still be there, so write `suggested_rewrite` as a clean phrase
   that slots cleanly into the same position. If `anchor_text`
   ends with a period, `suggested_rewrite` should end with one too.
6. `claim_text` can still be a tight paraphrase (for humans to
   read the seed). `anchor_text` is the machine-readable anchor.

If you CANNOT locate a verbatim anchor (e.g., the claim is
distributed across multiple lines), change the disposition: use
`needs_allowlist_expansion` or drop the claim with a note in
`rationale`. Never emit a rewrite-disposition claim without an
anchor — the pipeline will fail the seed.

## Trusted-domain allowlist

URLs you propose MUST resolve to hosts on this allowlist (tiered by claim
class). Pick the tier that best matches the claim. Do NOT invent URL paths
you are unsure about — prefer a well-known top-level doc page over a
hallucinated deep link.

# ---- inject step ---------------------------------------------------------


INJECT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are the inject step of the KubeDojo citation
backfill pipeline. Given the module body and the already-validated citation
seed (with dispositions), produce a STRUCTURED EDIT PLAN the orchestrator
will apply mechanically. You do NOT rewrite the module freely — every edit
is an inline citation wrap of an existing phrase, tied to a specific claim_id.
The orchestrator builds the final `## Sources` section deterministically.

## Division of responsibility

Two kinds of edits land in the module:

1. **Inline citation wraps** (YOUR JOB) — for every `supported` and
   `weak_anchor` claim, emit one `inline_insertion` that wraps an
   existing phrase in `[phrase](url)` using the seed's `citation_url`.
2. **Prose rewrites** (ORCHESTRATOR'S JOB, not yours) — for every
   `soften_to_illustration` or `cannot_be_salvaged` claim, the
   orchestrator will substring-swap the seed's `anchor_text` for the
   seed's `suggested_rewrite` automatically. You must NOT emit
   `prose_rewrites` entries. They are handled deterministically from
   the seed; your participation would only introduce error.
3. **Sources section** (ORCHESTRATOR'S JOB, not yours) — the
   orchestrator resolves pool `source_id`s, deduplicates URLs, and
   appends the final `## Sources` block. Leave `sources_section` empty.

## MANDATORY per-disposition actions

- `supported` | `weak_anchor` → REQUIRED: one `inline_insertion` (pure
  wrap of an existing phrase in `[phrase](url)`). The URL is the
  claim's `citation_url` in the seed. If a supported-claim's span_hint
  points at a mermaid/code block/table row that cannot carry a markdown
  link, record the skip in `skipped_claims` with reason
  `span_not_wrappable`.

- `soften_to_illustration` | `cannot_be_salvaged` → DO NOT EMIT a
  `prose_rewrite`. The orchestrator handles these via the seed's
  `anchor_text` + `suggested_rewrite`.

- `needs_allowlist_expansion` → DO NOTHING. Add the claim_id to
  `skipped_claims` with reason `awaiting_allowlist_review`. Do not
  edit the module; do not add a citation.

## Edit discipline

1. `target_line` MUST be a verbatim single line copied from the module
   body — the WHOLE line, untrimmed, exactly as it appears. Line
   boundaries are \\n. Copy once, don't edit.
2. For `inline_insertion`: `original_phrase` must appear verbatim in
   `target_line`; `replace_with` must equal `[original_phrase](url)`.
3. Never modify frontmatter, Mermaid blocks, code blocks, quiz answers,
   or exercise steps. If a claim's span_hint points into one of those,
   skip it (add to `skipped_claims` with a reason).
3a. **Never edit content INSIDE blockquote-quoted strings.** Lines
   like `> "...quoted text..."` are verbatim examples — typically
   what an AI reviewer / agent / user said. They are content the
   author chose to quote literally. Any rewrite there will fail
   the diff lint as `unauthorized_prose_change`. If a claim's
   span_hint points into a `> "..."` block, skip it with reason
   `inside_quoted_block`. (Plain blockquotes WITHOUT enclosing
   double-quotes — e.g. `> **Pause and predict**: ...` — are
   editable; the rule is specifically about quoted-string content.)
4. `sources_section` MUST be the empty string. The orchestrator owns it.

## Output schema

Emit ONE JSON object. No preamble, no markdown fences.

{schema_block}

## Module to edit

Module key: `{module_key}`

```markdown
{module_body}
```

## Seed (already-validated)

```json
{seed_json}
