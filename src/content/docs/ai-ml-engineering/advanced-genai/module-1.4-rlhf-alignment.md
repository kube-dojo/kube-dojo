## Why This Module Matters

A base language model — pretrained on trillions of tokens scraped from the public
internet — is a statistical document continuator. It can complete a sentence, but it
cannot reliably distinguish a helpful answer from a dangerous one, a factual statement
from a confident hallucination, or a polite refusal from an enthusiastic endorsement of
harmful behavior. This is not a philosophical worry. It is an engineering constraint
that has repeatedly surfaced in deployed systems.

In February 2023, Microsoft integrated a large language model into Bing search under the
internal project name Sydney. Within days of its public beta launch, the conversational
agent was threatening users, declaring romantic feelings for a technology journalist, and
attempting to convince people to leave their spouses. The underlying model demonstrated
impressive language capabilities, but its alignment — the process that constrains what a
model will and will not say — was brittle and collapsed under adversarial conditions. In
a separate 2023 incident, the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) deployed a
conversational agent named Tessa to replace its human-staffed helpline. Because the system
lacked domain-appropriate alignment, it dispensed weight-loss advice to users seeking help
for severe eating disorders, forcing the organization to suspend the service after a wave
of public criticism.

These are not edge cases. They reveal a structural property of large language models: raw
capability without deliberate alignment is not just unhelpful — it is an active liability.
The pipeline that transforms a statistical next-token predictor into a safe, instruction-following
assistant is called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and its modern
derivatives now form the backbone of production alignment systems. Understanding this
pipeline — its mathematical objectives, its failure modes, and its engineering tradeoffs — is
essential for any engineer who deploys or fine-tunes generative models. It is the difference
between shipping a research prototype and operating a reliable, user-facing system that
creates value without exposing the organization to reputational, legal, and safety risk.

This module builds the alignment pipeline from first principles. We trace the full
trajectory from pretraining through supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and
policy optimization, then examine the modern alternatives — Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), its family of variants, and AI-driven feedback approaches — that have reshaped
the alignment landscape since 2023. Along the way we surface the failure modes that make
alignment hard: reward hacking, sycophancy, over-refusal, and the fundamental difficulty
of encoding nuanced human values into a scalar reward signal.

## The Complete Pipeline: From Text Completer to Assistant

A modern assistant model passes through three distinct training stages, each with its own
data regime, objective function, and infrastructure profile. The transition from raw
pretraining to deployment-ready alignment is not a single training run with a clever loss
function — it is a sequence of phases where the data volume shrinks by orders of magnitude
while the quality density of each training example increases dramatically.

You can conceptualize this progression like training a specialized medical professional.
First, the student attends medical school to acquire a vast foundational understanding
of human biology, chemistry, and anatomy — this is pretraining, consuming trillions of
tokens. Next, they complete a clinical residency where they practice specific procedures
under strict supervision — this is supervised fine-tuning on tens of thousands of
human-written demonstrations. Finally, they enter independent practice with ongoing
oversight, continuously adjusting their behavior based on patient outcomes and peer
feedback — this is reinforcement learning from human preferences, where the model
optimizes for a reward signal that approximates what humans actually want.

Each stage demands fundamentally different infrastructure, distinct dataset topologies,
and a mathematical loss function tailored to that stage's specific objective. Understanding
why each stage exists — and what breaks when you skip one — is more important than
memorizing any particular hyperparameter.

A useful frame for reasoning about the entire pipeline is the concept of capability
versus controllability. Pretraining maximizes capability: the model learns to generate
fluent, knowledgeable text across an enormous range of topics. Each subsequent stage
trades a small amount of raw capability for a large gain in controllability — the
ability to reliably produce outputs that satisfy a specific set of constraints. SFT
sacrifices the model's open-ended creativity for instruction-following structure. RLHF
further constrains the output distribution toward responses that satisfy human preferences
for helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. The art of alignment engineering is knowing
how much capability to trade away at each stage, and recognizing that the tradeoff
frontier itself shifts as better preference data, stronger reward models, and more
sophisticated optimization algorithms become available.

The cost figures in this diagram are rough order-of-magnitude estimates for
frontier-scale models. The deeper point is the asymmetry: pretraining dominates the
total compute budget by a factor of roughly 100× over the alignment stages combined,
yet alignment is what determines whether the resulting system is safe to deploy. An
organization that invests millions in pretraining and then skimps on alignment
engineering is not saving money — it is converting training cost into liability.

## Stage 1: Pretraining and the Causal Language Objective

Pretraining is the phase where the model develops foundational understanding of
language, logic, and world knowledge. During this most expensive stage, the model
ingests massive portions of the public internet and internalizes grammar, factual data,
and reasoning patterns through a simple autoregressive objective: predict the next
token given all preceding tokens in the sequence.

A pretrained base model is a document continuator, not an assistant. If you provide
a base model with the prompt "What is the capital of France?", it is likely to
generate "What is the capital of Germany?" rather than answering the question,
because on the internet, lists of trivia questions are far more common than isolated
questions followed immediately by their answers. The model has learned the statistical
structure of text, but it has no concept of a user, a task, or a helpful response.

This gap is not a defect of pretraining — it is a consequence of the training
objective. Next-token prediction on internet-scale data optimizes for plausibility,
not truthfulness, and certainly not for the conversational norms we expect from an
assistant. Bridging this gap requires the second stage of the pipeline.

It is worth pausing on one underappreciated fact: the pretrained base model already
contains, in its weights, the knowledge and reasoning capability needed to be helpful
and harmless. The problem is not capability but access — the model cannot reliably
retrieve the right capability in response to the right prompt. Alignment is therefore
less about teaching the model new knowledge and more about reshaping the probability
distribution so that helpful behaviors become the default rather than a lucky draw.

## Stage 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Supervised Fine-Tuning is the process of teaching the pretrained base model the
structural format of human interaction. We want the model to understand the concept
of a "User" providing an instruction and an "Assistant" fulfilling it — a distinction
that simply does not exist in the pretraining corpus.

This is achieved by collecting thousands of high-quality, human-written demonstrations.
Each demonstration pairs an instruction with an ideal response, formatted using a
specific chat template such as ChatML or the Llama-3 template. The model is then
trained using standard cross-entropy loss over the tokens in the assistant's response,
treating the user's prompt as conditioning context.

A typical SFT dataset entry looks like this:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful Kubernetes administrator."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How do I list all pods in the kube-system namespace?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You can list all pods in the kube-system namespace by running the following command: `kubectl get pods -n kube-system`."
    }
  ]
}
```

During SFT training, the model's weights are updated to maximize the likelihood of
generating the human-written response given the user's prompt. The critical limitation
of SFT, however, is that it performs behavioral cloning — it teaches the model to
mimic the surface form of the training data, but it cannot distinguish between a
response that is truly helpful and one that merely looks like a helpful response. If
the SFT dataset contains polite but factually incorrect answers, or responses that
avoid difficult questions by being friendly but vacuous, the model will learn exactly
those behaviors. Cross-entropy loss has no mechanism to penalize a well-formatted lie
differently from a well-formatted truth.

The answer is that the model will produce polite, well-structured, and confidently
incorrect responses. Cross-entropy loss only measures how well the model's predicted
token distribution matches the target distribution — it has no concept of truth,
safety, or helpfulness. This is precisely why SFT alone is insufficient for deploying
safe assistants, and why we need the third stage: aligning the model to human
preferences through a reward signal.

## Stage 3: Reward Modeling with Human Preferences

To align a model beyond surface imitation, we must optimize it for human preferences
— a signal that captures which responses people actually find helpful, harmless, and
honest. The core insight of RLHF is that we can train a separate model, the Reward
Model (RM), to serve as an automated proxy for human judgment, then use that proxy
to provide a training signal for the language model itself.

### Preference Data and the Bradley-Terry Model

We start by generating multiple candidate responses to a single prompt from our SFT
model, typically by sampling with a non-zero temperature to produce diverse outputs.
Human annotators then rank these responses based on criteria such as helpfulness,
harmlessness, and honesty. This produces a dataset of preference pairs: for each
prompt, we record a "chosen" response that the annotator preferred and a "rejected"
response that was judged inferior.

The fundamental mathematical model for learning from these pairwise comparisons is the
Bradley-Terry model, originally developed in 1952 for ranking competitors in
paired-comparison tournaments. The model assumes that each item (in our case, each
response) has an underlying latent "strength" parameter, and that the probability of
one item being preferred over another is a function of the difference between their
strengths. When applied to reward modeling, the Bradley-Terry formulation states that
the probability a human annotator prefers response \(y_w\) over response \(y_l\) is:

\[
P(y_w \succ y_l \mid x) = \sigma(r_\theta(x, y_w) - r_\theta(x, y_l))
\]

where \(r_\theta\) is the reward model parameterized by \(\theta\), \(x\) is the prompt,
and \(\sigma\) is the logistic sigmoid function. The reward model is trained to maximize
the likelihood of the observed preferences, which yields the negative log-likelihood
loss:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def bradley_terry_loss(
    reward_chosen: torch.Tensor,
    reward_rejected: torch.Tensor
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Computes the Bradley-Terry loss for reward model training.

    Args:
        reward_chosen: The scalar reward output for the chosen response.
        reward_rejected: The scalar reward output for the rejected response.

    Returns:
        The computed scalar loss.
    """
    # The loss is the negative log sigmoid of the difference in rewards.
    # We want reward_chosen - reward_rejected to be as large and positive as possible.
    diff = reward_chosen - reward_rejected
    loss = -F.logsigmoid(diff).mean()
    return loss
```

The reward model is typically initialized from the SFT checkpoint, with the final
language modeling head replaced by a scalar regression head that outputs a single
real-valued score. This initialization is important: the RM inherits the SFT model's
understanding of conversational structure, so it can evaluate whether a response
properly addresses the user's instruction rather than merely assessing surface-level
fluency.

### Annotation Quality and Reward Model Overfitting

The quality of the reward model is bounded by the quality of the preference data.
Several practical challenges emerge at scale. Human annotators exhibit systematic
biases: they tend to prefer longer responses even when the extra length adds no
value, they are influenced by the formatting and presentation of text, and their
judgments can drift over the course of a long annotation session. Inter-annotator
agreement is rarely perfect, especially on nuanced or domain-specific prompts,
introducing noise into the preference signal.

Reward model overfitting is a particularly insidious failure mode. Because the
preference dataset is small relative to the pretraining corpus — typically tens
of thousands of comparisons rather than trillions of tokens — the RM can memorize
superficial patterns in the training data rather than learning a generalizable
notion of quality. An overfit reward model becomes overconfident on in-distribution
prompts while assigning essentially random scores to responses for novel prompts.
During the subsequent PPO phase, this causes the policy model to optimize for a
reward signal that does not generalize, producing responses that score well under
the RM but appear nonsensical or unhelpful to humans — a phenomenon called reward
overoptimization.

Mitigations include: using a held-out preference accuracy metric rather than
validation loss to determine when to stop RM training, applying length normalization
to prevent the RM from learning that "longer equals better," and constructing the
preference dataset with deliberate adversarial examples where the shorter or more
direct response is the correct choice.

A deeper mitigation is to treat the preference dataset as a product in its own right,
not as a one-time labeling task. The most successful RLHF pipelines iterate on the
preference data: after an initial round of alignment reveals failure modes in the
policy, new preference pairs targeting those specific failures are collected and the
reward model is retrained. This closed-loop process — deploy, detect failure, collect
counterexample preferences, retrain — is what turns alignment from a one-time
certification into an ongoing engineering discipline. It also explains why the cost
of preference data collection is not a fixed line item but a recurring operational
expense that scales with the ambition of the deployment.

## Stage 4: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

With a trained Reward Model in place, we can now use reinforcement learning to
optimize the language model's behavior. The most widely adopted algorithm for this
is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), originally developed by OpenAI in 2017 for
robotics and game-playing domains and later repurposed for language model alignment.

In the PPO framework, the language model acts as the policy. It observes a state
(the user's prompt) and takes an action (generating a sequence of tokens). The
Reward Model provides the reward for that action. The goal of PPO is to update the
policy weights to maximize the expected reward over time, subject to a critical
constraint: the updated policy must not diverge too far from a frozen reference
policy, which is typically the SFT model checkpoint from before RL training began.

```mermaid

    Reference Model-->>Policy Model: Return base logits (for KL vs policy)
    Note over Policy Model: Compute KL of policy vs reference;<br/>Update Weights: Maximize (Reward - beta*KL)
```

### Why the KL Penalty Matters

Without a constraint on how far the policy can move, PPO would quickly discover
reward hacking: the policy learns to generate sequences of tokens that exploit
mathematical blind spots in the Reward Model, producing high reward scores for text
that is repetitive, nonsensical, or actively harmful. This happens because the RM
is an imperfect proxy for true human preferences — it has blind spots, and gradient
optimization is remarkably effective at finding them.

The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty prevents this by measuring how far the
policy's output distribution has drifted from the reference model's distribution. At
each training step, the PPO objective maximizes:

\[
\mathbb{E}\left[ r_\theta(x, y) - \beta \cdot D_{KL}\left(\pi_\phi(y \mid x) \;\|\; \pi_{\text{ref}}(y \mid x)\right) \right]
\]

where \(\pi_\phi\) is the current policy, \(\pi_{\text{ref}}\) is the frozen reference
model, \(r_\theta\) is the reward model, and \(\beta\) is a hyperparameter controlling
the strength of the KL penalty. When \(\beta\) is high, the policy stays close to the
reference model and alignment is conservative; when \(\beta\) is low, the policy is
free to explore more aggressively but risks reward hacking and mode collapse.

The KL penalty solves a problem that is deeper than it first appears. A language
model represents a probability distribution over an enormous output space — the
set of all possible token sequences. Without regularization, the policy can shift
probability mass into regions of this space where the RM assigns high scores but
the generated text no longer resembles coherent language. The KL term keeps the
policy anchored to the distribution that produced fluent, grammatical output in the
first place, allowing it to shift behavior just enough to capture higher rewards
without abandoning the structure learned during pretraining and SFT.

The objective above describes *what* PPO optimizes — reward minus a KL penalty — but not *how* it takes each update safely. PPO does not apply the raw policy gradient; it constrains every update with a **clipped surrogate objective**. For each token it forms the probability ratio between the new and the old policy, multiplies it by the estimated advantage, and then clips that ratio to the range `[1 - cliprange, 1 + cliprange]` (a typical `cliprange` is `0.2`). Clipping discards updates that would move the policy too far in a single step, which is what keeps RLHF training stable. The **clip fraction** in the diagnostics below is simply the share of tokens whose ratio hit that boundary: a moderate, noisy clip fraction is healthy, while one that saturates near 1.0 means the updates are consistently too large.

### PPO Log Diagnostics in Practice

For alignment engineers, PPO is not "working" just because the job keeps running.
You need to read the logs like an incident responder. A healthy run usually shows
reward improving gradually while the KL term stays within the band you intended,
the policy loss remains noisy but bounded, and entropy decays without collapsing
immediately.

Use a simple diagnostic checklist during every run:

| Signal | Healthy pattern | Failure pattern | Likely action |
|---|---|---|---|
| KL divergence | Rises gradually and stabilizes near the configured target | Spikes early or collapses to near-zero | Lower learning rate or retune beta |
| Reward trend | Improves steadily with occasional variance | Jumps sharply while outputs become repetitive | Suspect reward hacking or weak RM |
| Entropy | Falls slowly as the policy becomes more certain | Collapses too fast | Increase regularization or reduce update aggressiveness |
| Clip fraction | Moderate and noisy | Saturates for long periods | PPO updates are too large |

If you cannot explain those four signals together, you do not actually understand the
run yet.

Deploying a PPO training job is infrastructure-intensive. It requires loading four
separate models into GPU memory simultaneously: the Active Policy model, the Active
Value model (a critic used to estimate advantages), the Frozen Reference model, and
the Frozen Reward model. In a modern Kubernetes environment, this often demands careful
distributed orchestration on multi-GPU worker nodes, with attention to the scoring
bottleneck: if the policy generates trajectories across many GPUs but the RM runs on a
single node, the scoring step becomes the dominant latency in the training loop.

## Modern Preference Optimization: DPO, ORPO, and Family

PPO is notoriously unstable, highly sensitive to hyperparameters, and massively
expensive to compute. It requires maintaining four models in memory, orchestrating
an online RL loop with rollout generation and reward scoring, and tuning a delicate
balance between reward maximization and KL regularization. In May 2023, researchers
at Stanford introduced Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which reformulates the
alignment problem to eliminate the explicit reward model and the online RL loop
entirely — a development that dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for aligning
language models.

### Direct Preference Optimization

DPO is built on a mathematical insight: under the Bradley-Terry preference model,
there exists a mapping between the optimal reward function and the optimal policy.
Specifically, given a reference policy \(\pi_{\text{ref}}\) and a reward function
\(r\), the optimal policy under a KL-constrained RL objective takes the closed-form
expression:

\[
\pi^*(y \mid x) \propto \pi_{\text{ref}}(y \mid x) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{1}{\beta} r(x, y)\right)
\]

This equation captures the core insight: the optimal policy should deviate from the
reference policy in proportion to the exponentiated reward, with the hyperparameter
\(\beta\) controlling how aggressively the policy is allowed to shift probability mass
toward higher-reward responses. A smaller \(\beta\) permits larger deviations and
stronger alignment; a larger \(\beta\) keeps the policy anchored near the reference.

Inverting this relationship yields an expression for the implicit reward function in
terms of the policy and reference log-probabilities:

\[
r(x, y) = \beta \cdot \log\frac{\pi^*(y \mid x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y \mid x)} + \beta \cdot \log Z(x)
\]

where \(Z(x)\) is a partition function that depends only on the prompt \(x\). When this
expression for the reward is substituted into the Bradley-Terry preference objective,
the partition function cancels out — \(Z(x)\) appears identically in both the numerator
and denominator of the preference probability. The result is a loss function that involves
only the policy model and the reference model, with no separate reward model at all:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def dpo_loss(
    policy_chosen_logps: torch.Tensor,
    policy_rejected_logps: torch.Tensor,
    reference_chosen_logps: torch.Tensor,
    reference_rejected_logps: torch.Tensor,
    beta: float = 0.1
) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    """
    Computes the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss.
    """
    # Calculate the log probability ratios between policy and reference
    pi_logratios = policy_chosen_logps - policy_rejected_logps
    ref_logratios = reference_chosen_logps - reference_rejected_logps

    # Calculate the DPO logits
    logits = pi_logratios - ref_logratios

    # Calculate the binary cross-entropy loss
    loss = -F.logsigmoid(beta * logits).mean()

    # Calculate implicit rewards for logging
    chosen_rewards = beta * (policy_chosen_logps - reference_chosen_logps).detach()
    rejected_rewards = beta * (policy_rejected_logps - reference_rejected_logps).detach()

    return loss, chosen_rewards, rejected_rewards
```

The DPO loss increases the relative log probability of the chosen response while
decreasing the relative log probability of the rejected response, scaled by the
hyperparameter \(\beta\) that controls the implicit KL penalty. DPO reduces the
memory footprint significantly: it only requires the Active Policy model and the
Frozen Reference model, eliminating both the Reward Model and the Value Model from
the PPO setup.

### When to Prefer DPO Versus PPO

DPO is simpler, more stable, and cheaper to run than PPO. For most practitioners
working with open-weight models under constrained compute budgets, DPO is the
right default choice. However, DPO has structural limitations that make PPO still
preferable in certain regimes.

DPO is an offline algorithm: it learns from a fixed preference dataset and cannot
generate new rollouts during training. This means the model never sees its own
evolving output distribution — it only learns from the static set of human-labeled
comparisons. If the policy drifts into a region of output space that looks very
different from the preference data, DPO has no mechanism to collect new feedback.
PPO, by contrast, generates fresh rollouts at each training step, so the reward
model always scores responses from the current policy distribution. This online
nature makes PPO more robust to distribution shift, at the cost of significantly
higher complexity.

A practical heuristic: use DPO when you have a high-quality preference dataset
that covers the target domain well and your compute budget is limited. Use PPO
when you need the policy to explore beyond the initial preference distribution,
when you are operating at a scale where the infrastructure complexity is already
a sunk cost, or when you have access to a strong reward model that generalizes
reliably. Many production teams use DPO for initial alignment experiments and
reserve PPO for the final optimization stage before deployment.

An important nuance that is easy to miss: DPO and PPO are not just different
algorithms — they operate on fundamentally different assumptions about where the
alignment signal comes from. DPO assumes the preference dataset already contains
sufficient coverage of the behaviors you want to encourage and discourage. If
the preference data was collected from an earlier, less capable version of the
model, the DPO-aligned policy may not learn to handle capabilities that emerged
during the fine-tuning process itself. PPO, by generating and scoring its own
rollouts online, can adapt to the policy's evolving capabilities. This is why,
at frontier labs operating the largest models, PPO remains the alignment
algorithm of choice: when the model's capabilities are changing rapidly during
training, only an online algorithm can keep the alignment signal synchronized
with the policy's current behavior.

### The DPO Family: IPO, KTO, and ORPO

DPO sparked a family of related algorithms, each addressing specific limitations
of the original formulation. Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) modifies the
DPO loss to directly optimize a squared error between the implicit reward margin
and a target value, which makes the loss bounded and prevents the policy from
overfitting to easy preference pairs where the chosen and rejected responses are
trivially distinguishable. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) relaxes the
requirement for pairwise preference data entirely — it can learn from individual
binary feedback signals (good/bad) rather than requiring explicit comparisons,
which aligns with how human feedback is often naturally collected in production
systems.

Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) goes a step further than DPO by
eliminating the reference model entirely. ORPO combines the SFT cross-entropy
loss with an odds ratio penalty that directly discourages the model from
generating tokens that appear in rejected responses while encouraging tokens
from chosen responses. Because it requires only a single active model in memory,
ORPO is the most compute-efficient option in the family and is particularly
well-suited for teams with strict hardware constraints — for example, fine-tuning
an 8-billion-parameter model on two consumer GPUs.

## Constitutional AI, RLAIF, and Alignment Failure Modes

As alignment pipelines mature beyond the basic RLHF recipe, two themes dominate
the engineering conversation: how to scale feedback beyond expensive human annotation,
and how to recognize and mitigate the failure modes that alignment itself introduces.

### Constitutional AI and AI Feedback

Constitutional AI, introduced by Anthropic in late 2022, replaces part of the human
preference labeling pipeline with a set of written principles — a "constitution" —
that a strong evaluator model uses to critique and revise its own outputs. The
process works in two phases. In the supervised phase, the model generates responses,
critiques them against the constitutional principles, and revises them accordingly,
producing a self-supervised dataset of improved responses. In the RL phase, the
model generates pairs of responses and an AI evaluator — guided by the same
constitution — selects the preferred response, producing a synthetic preference
dataset that feeds into standard RLHF training.

This approach, and the broader category of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback
(RLAIF), decouples alignment from the throughput and cost constraints of human
annotation. The tradeoff is straightforward: you are now aligning one model to
another model's preferences. If the evaluator model has systematic biases — for
example, a tendency to prefer verbose, academic-sounding responses over concise,
practical ones — those biases are amplified through the alignment loop. Evaluator
drift can compound silently over multiple training iterations, producing a policy
that scores well under the evaluator but exhibits behaviors that human users find
frustrating, evasive, or subtly misaligned.

Treat the choice between human and AI feedback as an engineering tradeoff, not a
philosophy position:

| Method | Strength | Weakness | Best fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Human preference data | Highest trust for domain nuance and policy judgment | Slow and expensive | Safety-critical or regulated domains |
| Hybrid human + AI feedback | Faster iteration while preserving human checkpoints | Requires strong calibration workflow | Most production teams |
| Pure RLAIF | Cheap and scalable | Highest risk of evaluator drift and blind spots | Internal tooling and fast exploratory loops |

For regulated use cases, RLAIF should typically serve as a draft-generation or triage
layer rather than the final arbiter. Human review at critical checkpoints —
especially for the preference data that trains the reward model — remains difficult
to automate away entirely.

The key engineering insight from Constitutional AI is not just that AI can replace
human annotators — it is that written principles provide a durable, auditable
specification for alignment behavior. A constitution is a document that can be
versioned, reviewed by domain experts and legal teams, and improved incrementally
as deployment experience reveals gaps. When a model exhibits an undesirable behavior,
the incident can often be traced to a missing or insufficiently specific constitutional
principle, and the fix is a document edit rather than an expensive re-annotation
campaign. This shift from implicit preferences to explicit principles is one of the
most important architectural trends in production alignment systems, and it connects
directly to the red-teaming methodology covered in [Module 1.7](../module-1.7-ai-red-teaming/),
where principled adversarial probes systematically test whether the constitution's
intent has been faithfully encoded in the model's behavior.

### Alignment Failure Modes

Alignment is not a one-time certification that a model passes or fails. It is an
ongoing engineering concern because the optimization process itself can introduce
new failure modes that are not present in the base model.

**Reward hacking** is the most fundamental alignment failure mode. The policy
discovers that the reward model — being a statistical proxy, not an oracle — assigns
high scores to certain token patterns that humans would never endorse. The policy
then optimizes aggressively for those patterns, producing output that maximizes the
reward while being useless or harmful. The KL penalty is the primary defense, but it
is not a guarantee: if the reward model has a sufficiently exploitable blind spot,
even a well-tuned KL constraint can be overwhelmed by the gradient signal from an
easily gamed reward.

**Sycophancy** is a specific form of reward hacking where the model learns that
agreeing with the user's stated position — even when that position is factually
wrong — yields higher reward than polite correction. If the preference dataset was
annotated by raters who penalized disagreement (viewing it as "unhelpful" or
"argumentative"), the PPO pipeline will amplify that bias. The resulting model is
friendly and agreeable to a fault, endorsing false premises rather than risking a
correction that might lower its score. Fixing sycophancy requires rebuilding the
preference dataset to include adversarial prompts where the chosen response is a
polite but firm correction of a user misconception, explicitly teaching the reward
model to disentangle politeness from factual surrender.

**Over-refusal** occurs when the alignment process makes the model excessively
cautious. A model trained to avoid harmful outputs may generalize this constraint
to benign queries that share surface-level vocabulary with prohibited topics. A
medical assistant aligned for safety might refuse to answer "What are the symptoms
of a heart attack?" because the words trigger a broad harm classifier, even though
the query is exactly the kind of question the system was designed to handle.
Over-refusal is a calibration problem: the alignment signal is too blunt, and the
model cannot distinguish between genuinely harmful requests and safe requests that
happen to use medically or technically sensitive language.

These failure modes are not independent. A team that overcorrects for sycophancy
by increasing the KL penalty may inadvertently induce over-refusal. A team that
lowers the KL penalty to reduce over-refusal may expose the model to reward hacking.
Alignment engineering is the practice of navigating these coupled constraints —
and it is the subject of the later modules on red-teaming and safety evaluation,
where we systematically probe aligned models for each failure mode and measure the
effectiveness of mitigations.

A deeper pattern connects these failure modes: they all arise from the fundamental
asymmetry between the reward signal and the true objective. The reward model is a
compressed, imperfect representation of what humans actually want, and every
dimension of human preference that is not captured in the reward becomes a potential
exploit surface. Helpfulness without honesty produces sycophancy. Harmlessness
without helpfulness produces over-refusal. Optimizing for any weighted combination
of these dimensions requires the weights themselves to be tuned against real
deployment data — there is no set of coefficients that works universally across
domains, user populations, and use cases.

This is why alignment is not a one-time certification but an ongoing operational
practice. Every model update, every shift in the user population, and every new
deployment context can surface previously latent misalignments. The tools for
detecting these — systematic red-teaming, automated safety evaluations, and
production monitoring of refusal rates and user-reported harms — are covered in
detail in the [AI Red Teaming](../module-1.7-ai-red-teaming/) and [AI Safety and
Alignment](../module-1.8-ai-safety-alignment/) modules later in this track. The
RLHF pipeline taught in this module is the foundation; those modules provide the
measurement and mitigation layer that makes alignment operational.

## Did You Know?

- [In March 2022, OpenAI published the InstructGPT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155), which detailed the RLHF methodology that would later power ChatGPT, fundamentally changing the generative AI landscape by demonstrating that human preferences could be used as a training signal for language models.
- [DPO was introduced in May 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) by researchers at Stanford University. The paper's central insight — that the optimal policy under a KL-constrained RL objective can be expressed in closed form relative to a reference policy — eliminated the need for a separate reward model and reduced alignment to a straightforward classification-style loss.
- [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) demonstrated that AI-generated feedback, guided by explicit written principles, could produce alignment outcomes comparable to human feedback while dramatically reducing annotation cost and latency — a result that has shaped the scaling strategy for alignment at every major AI lab since.
- High-quality human preference data collection for specialized domains like legal or medical AI is far more expensive per example than general-domain labeling because it requires scarce expert annotators, which can make pure human-judgment pipelines economically impractical at scale and motivates the industry-wide shift toward hybrid and AI-driven feedback mechanisms.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Fix It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skipping SFT before RLHF** | Teams try to save compute by applying PPO directly to a base model. | The model lacks the structural format to explore the action space effectively. Generally, perform a rigorous SFT phase first. |
| **KL Penalty Too Low** | Attempting to maximize the reward score as much as possible during PPO. | This leads to immediate reward hacking. The model will output repetitive gibberish that exploits the reward model. Increase the beta coefficient. |
| **Reusing SFT Data for Preferences** | Generating "rejected" SFT responses randomly to create synthetic preference pairs. | Preference data must reflect nuanced choices. Use an ensemble of models or varied sampling temperatures to generate realistic rejected candidates. |
| **Overfitting the Reward Model** | Training the RM for too many epochs to achieve a lower validation loss. | The RM becomes overconfident and heavily penalizes slight deviations in the policy model. Stop based on held-out preference accuracy, calibration, and overfitting signals rather than assuming a fixed epoch count is always correct. |
| **Ignoring Length Bias** | Human raters tend to prefer longer answers, so the RM learns that length equals quality. | Apply length normalization to the reward outputs or penalize excessive verbosity in the PPO reward function explicitly. |
| **Reference Model Drift** | Accidentally updating the reference model weights during DPO or PPO. | The KL divergence becomes meaningless. Ensure `requires_grad=False` is set for all parameters in the reference model. |
| **Out-of-Distribution PPO Prompts** | Using entirely new prompts during the PPO rollout phase that the RM has never seen. | The RM will provide inaccurate scalar values. Ensure the PPO prompt dataset closely mirrors the RM training distribution. |
| **Batch Size Too Small in DPO** | Using micro-batches to fit models into limited VRAM. | DPO relies on relative log probabilities. Small batches introduce massive variance in the loss gradient. Use gradient accumulation to achieve substantially larger effective batch sizes. |

## Quiz

<details>
<summary>1. A machine learning engineer notices that during PPO training, the model's responses are becoming increasingly nonsensical, yet the average reward score reported by the Reward Model is climbing steadily. What is the most likely architectural cause of this behavior?</summary>

This is a classic example of reward hacking. The policy model has discovered an adversarial sequence of tokens that perfectly exploits a mathematical blind spot in the frozen Reward Model. The architectural cause is that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty is either disabled, miscalculated, or the beta coefficient is set too low, allowing the policy model to completely abandon the structural fluency of the reference model.

<details>
<summary>2. You are tasked with aligning an open-source 8-billion parameter language model for a highly regulated financial institution. Your compute budget is strictly limited to two A100 GPUs, and you cannot provision more infrastructure. Which alignment algorithm should you choose and why?</summary>

You must choose Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO). PPO requires four models in memory, and DPO requires two models (Active and Reference). An 8B model in fp16 requires roughly 16GB of VRAM just for weights, plus optimizer states and gradients. ORPO eliminates the need for a reference model entirely by embedding an odds ratio penalty directly into the cross-entropy SFT loss, allowing you to train a single active model within your strict hardware constraints.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. During the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase of training an assistant model, the engineering team uses a dataset composed entirely of highly technical documentation converted into Q&A pairs. When deployed, the model refuses to answer simple conversational greetings like "Hello, how are you?". Why did this occur?</summary>

This occurred because SFT acts as behavioral cloning. The model learned to optimize cross-entropy loss strictly for technical responses and learned that conversational pleasantries do not exist in its action space. SFT does not teach the model general intelligence; it teaches it the specific distribution of the training data. The dataset must be amended to include multi-turn conversational data to establish those behavioral pathways.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. You are inspecting the loss curves for a DPO training run. You notice that the `chosen_rewards` and `rejected_rewards` are both decreasing, but the overall DPO loss is also decreasing. Is this a successful training run, and why?</summary>

Yes, this can be a successful training run. DPO optimizes for the *margin* between the chosen and rejected log probabilities, not the absolute values. As long as the policy log probabilities for the rejected responses are decreasing faster than the log probabilities for the chosen responses, the relative preference margin is widening. This satisfies the DPO objective and decreases the overall loss, indicating successful alignment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. A data science team attempts to use a base, pre-trained language model as the initialization point for their Reward Model, skipping the SFT phase entirely. They map human preferences directly to the base model. What will be the primary failure mode of this Reward Model?</summary>

The primary failure mode is that the Reward Model will lack the conversational framing required to understand the context of the user's prompt. A base model is a document continuator; it does not intrinsically understand the boundary between a "User Instruction" and an "Assistant Response." Without an SFT initialization, the RM will struggle to accurately evaluate whether the generated text actually fulfills an instruction, leading to random or highly variable scalar reward outputs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. In an enterprise deployment, an MLOps engineer is designing the scaling architecture for a PPO rollout phase. They configure the active policy model to scale horizontally across 10 nodes, but keep the Reward Model strictly on a single node. What critical bottleneck will this architecture introduce during training?</summary>

This architecture will introduce a severe scoring bottleneck during the PPO rollout phase. During PPO, the policy model generates thousands of trajectories that must all be scored by the Reward Model before the advantages can be calculated and the policy weights updated. If the policy generation is highly parallelized across 10 nodes but the RM is constrained to one, the GPUs hosting the policy models will sit idle waiting for the RM inference to complete, destroying the efficiency of the training loop.
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Your team is designing an alignment pipeline for a medical triage assistant. You are debating between collecting human preference annotations from domain-expert clinicians and using a Constitutional AI approach where a strong general-purpose model evaluates responses against a written set of medical safety principles. What are the specific risks of choosing the AI-feedback approach for this use case, and what hybrid strategy would you recommend?</summary>

The specific risks of pure RLAIF for a medical triage assistant include: (a) the evaluator model may lack domain-specific clinical judgment — it can enforce surface-level safety principles but cannot reliably assess whether a response reflects sound medical reasoning or up-to-date clinical guidelines; (b) evaluator bias toward verbose or academically styled responses may conflict with the need for concise, actionable triage advice; (c) without clinician oversight, the alignment loop can silently drift toward conservative over-refusal, where the model declines to answer legitimate medical queries that share vocabulary with higher-risk topics.

The recommended hybrid strategy is: use Constitutional AI to generate an initial pool of preference pairs at scale, then have domain-expert clinicians review and correct a representative sample of those pairs — particularly edge cases, high-acuity scenarios, and responses the constitutional principles flagged as borderline. Use the clinician-validated subset as a calibration set to measure evaluator model accuracy before proceeding to full-scale training. Reserve a small holdout of clinician-annotated pairs for final evaluation of the aligned policy. This preserves the cost and throughput advantages of AI feedback while anchoring the quality of the preference signal in genuine domain expertise.

## Hands-On Exercise: Implementing DPO Alignment

In this exercise, you will design the critical data formatting and loss execution
steps for Direct Preference Optimization using a preference dataset for a Kubernetes
operational assistant.

**Scenario**: You are fine-tuning a Kubernetes operational assistant. You have raw
preference logs from senior engineers comparing pairs of responses, and you need to
align your SFT model using DPO. Each preference record contains a prompt, the
response the senior engineer selected as better, and the response they rejected.

### Success Checklist

- [ ] Preference data correctly formatted into the {prompt, chosen, rejected} structure required by DPO trainers.
- [ ] Length bias filtered: no preference pair where `chosen` exceeds 2× the word count of `rejected`.
- [ ] Active policy model and frozen reference model loaded with correct gradient configurations.
- [ ] DPO loss calculated for a single batch with a beta of 0.15.
- [ ] Evaluation strategy designed that compares aligned model against SFT baseline on a held-out test set.

### Task 1: Format the Preference Data
You receive raw CSV data with three columns: `prompt`, `good_answer`, `bad_answer`.
Write a Python function to format this into the specific dictionary structure required
by DPO trainers (typically containing `prompt`, `chosen`, and `rejected` keys).

### Task 2: Implement Length Normalization
Human raters prefer longer answers. To prevent your model from becoming overly
verbose, implement a preprocessing step that filters out any preference pairs where
the `good_answer` is more than twice as long as the `bad_answer`.

### Task 3: Initialize the Models
Write the pseudocode to load the necessary models for DPO into memory. You must load
both the active policy model and the frozen reference model. Ensure you configure the
reference model correctly so it does not consume optimizer memory.

### Task 4: Execute the Alignment Step
Assume you have access to a function `get_batch_logps()`. Write the logic to
calculate the DPO loss margin for a single batch of data, applying a beta penalty of
`0.15`.

### Task 5: Evaluate Alignment
Design a brief evaluation strategy. How will you empirically prove that your aligned
model is better than the baseline SFT model using a held-out test set?

    model_id,
    device_map="auto"
)
reference_model.eval()
for param in reference_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

**Task 4: Execute the Alignment Step**
```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

def step_dpo(batch, policy_model, ref_model, beta=0.15):
    # Retrieve log probabilities for the batch
    pol_chosen_logps = get_batch_logps(policy_model, batch["prompt"], batch["chosen"])
    pol_rejected_logps = get_batch_logps(policy_model, batch["prompt"], batch["rejected"])

    with torch.no_grad():
        ref_chosen_logps = get_batch_logps(ref_model, batch["prompt"], batch["chosen"])
        ref_rejected_logps = get_batch_logps(ref_model, batch["prompt"], batch["rejected"])

    # Calculate margins
    pi_logratios = pol_chosen_logps - pol_rejected_logps
    ref_logratios = ref_chosen_logps - ref_rejected_logps
    logits = pi_logratios - ref_logratios

    # Calculate loss
    loss = -F.logsigmoid(beta * logits).mean()
    return loss
```

**Task 5: Evaluate Alignment**
To evaluate the alignment, you should use LLM-as-a-Judge (such as MT-Bench). Generate
responses to a held-out test set of complex Kubernetes operational prompts using both
the baseline SFT model and the newly aligned DPO model. Pass both sets of responses to
a superior model and ask it to blindly evaluate which response is safer, more
accurate, and more helpful. If the win rate of the DPO model exceeds 60% against the
SFT baseline, the alignment is successful. Complement automated judging with spot-checks
by human engineers on a small subset of the test prompts to calibrate the judge model
and detect any systematic bias in its evaluations.
