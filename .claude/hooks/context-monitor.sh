# triggers, demanding a session handoff to docs/session-state/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md
# instead (per CLAUDE.md session workflow).

#   75% -> heads-up: prepare handoff soon
#   85% -> critical: finish current task, write handoff, end session
#   95% -> emergency: stop now, write handoff this turn, /exit immediately

# Compaction is far more expensive than session handoff: handoff is just a
# small markdown file the next session reads on startup; compaction is a
# billed model call summarizing your entire conversation.
